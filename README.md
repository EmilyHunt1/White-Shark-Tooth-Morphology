# White-Shark-Tooth-Morphology
Classic Morphometric and EFA datasets
Classic Morphometrics = tooth (crown) height (TH), tooth width (TW), the thickness at the base of the teeth (BT), the interdental distance between the tips of the teeth (IDD), the basal gap between the base of the teeth (BG), and the width at the midpoint of the tooth (MTW) 
EFA are coordinates from tooth outlines
